HOW TO ADD A MOD - EXPERTS:
  If you know how JavaScript works, and you don't want to have to follow the simplified instructions below,
  simply open the file 'scripts/findmods.js', look for the array called 'MODS', and add the name of the mod to the end of the array.


HOW TO ADD A MOD - BEGINNERS:
(if you know how JavaScript works, you can skip to the step at the bottom of the page)
1) Find the name of the mod. This will be the name of its file in the 'mods' folder, without the '.js'.
   For example, the core mod has the file name 'core.js', and its name is 'core'.
2) Open the folder called 'scripts'.
3) In the 'scripts' folder, open the file called 'findmods.js'.
4) Towards the top of the file, you should see a line that says 'var MODS = [',
   followed by one or more lines with text in quotation marks. (for example, '"core",')

   WARNING: Be very careful with the next few steps. The file you are editing is part of the game's code.
   If you edit the wrong part of this file, you will break the game.
   There are comments in the file that will tell you what parts not to touch.
   --------------------------------------
   
5) Go to the last of these lines, and create a new line below it.
   Directly below your new line, there should be the line that says '];'.
   If there isn't, your line is in the wrong place: Re-read the instructions and try again.
6) On your new line, write the name of the mod in quotation marks, followed by a comma.
   For example, to load the core mod, you would write:
   "core",
7) Save and exit the file. Your mod should now be loaded!
