## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you need to report a vulnerability, please use the contact details present in the security.txt file present on olivercjcox.uk (We'd put the address here, but we don't want it to get picked up by scrapers!). If you don't know how to find this, submit a PR asking for contact details and we'll contact you. If you wish to encrypt your message, you can find our PGP key here: https://olivercjcox.uk/security/public_key.txt

We'll try to get back to you as soon as possible to let you know what we're doing to address the vulnerability, and will strive to keep you updated throughout the resolution process.
